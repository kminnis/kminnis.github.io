"This Halloween marks the first that I've actually experienced handing out treats to the kids in our neighborhood. Rick, one of my co-workers and neighbors, had said that in years past they've had around 150-175 kids so I thought Kim and I'd better be ready. So we purchased a ton of candy hoping that we'd have enough for the masses. We got to see lots of different costumes...3 different spider mans (didn't know there was more than one of them) Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz along with a Hershey's Kiss that was carrying Toto...3 different Tiggers and assortment of others. We think we had around 93 or so. After handing out treats we went up to Tony and Tasha Vorm's place and hung out with them a bit. We had to get some pictures with [Jayden and Addisyn]("http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fjayden%2F010-week8&img=res_1377023177.jpg). Who knew that he would already have  a girlfriend. haha. :)

We had Jayden all dressed up in his little [Tigger outfit]("http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fjayden%2F010-week8&img=res_391584584.jpg). He was oh [so cute]("http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fjayden%2F010-week8&img=res_701958944.jpg)! (He's going to kill us when he's a senior and we show everyone his pictures haha). But, our little Tigger eventually wore himself out and [needed to rest]("http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fjayden%2F010-week8&img=res_919220996.jpg). He was mostly wore out from his visit to the doctor on Friday. He had his 2 month checkup (yeah, I know, already!!!) and got his first round of shots. He came through the shots OK and weighed in at 11 lbs. and 13 oz and grew a couple of inches or so."
