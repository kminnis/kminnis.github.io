We got pounded with about 2 inches of rain yesterday in about a half an hour. Man, talk about crazy.  We drove around to see what else we could find, but didn't really come across any life threatening events. So that was uneventful.

Wood floors can be expensive to refinish. I'm in the process of getting everything around to refinish our [Great Room"](http://flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/53453233/) and [dining area](http://flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/53453254/). Let's just say that by the time it's done we could have gone to some exotic island. Okay, so maybe not that expensive, but it's still takes a few Benjamins to get the job done.

Kim had another baby-2-be checkup on Monday. Everything's looking and sounding "A-OK". She gained an additional 6 ponds in a month and a week so she's right on schedule.
