This weekend was pretty busy. Friday night Kim and I went and registered at Target for the [Baby Registry](http://snipurl.com/7dt3). I like registering for stuff. :) Hard telling if we get much from the list, but it's still fun to make a wish list. 

Saturday was filled with sitting in a class at our hospital learning all the various breathing techniques, focus procedures and other techniques to help in the labor process. It was quite informative. But, sitting there in a classroom on Saturday was not fun. I'm glad that I'm not pursuing any further education at this time as I'm not sure if I'd be able to sit through classes while on my "free" time. Learning on the job is much more fulfilling. Anyway, back to the baby school...during the class the "support partners" and the women split up and discussed what things we liked/disliked about pregnancy. It was cool to see that complete strangers had similar experiences with pregnancy.
