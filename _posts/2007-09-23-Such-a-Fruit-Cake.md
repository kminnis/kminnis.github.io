Those are the words coming out of Jayden's mouth as we were eating supper one night. A lot has happened since my last blog entry. Sorry, life got busy so I didn't have time to get this updated. As you can see from the picture to the left, Jayden turned three in August. 

[<img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1028/1306126006_0ecfd44c91_t.jpg" width="100" height="68" alt="Mom and Karrie" style="padding:5px;" align="Right" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/1306126006/) Karrie, my sister, made a surprise visit to my Parent's home and it happened to fall on the same weekend that we had Jayden's B-Day party so she was able to make it too.

Josie likes wearing his hat and does a pretty good job modeling it. :)

If you're ever looking for something fun for the kids during bath time, shaving cream is another option.

Jayden feel asleep on his pillow in the living room during the middle of the day. :) [<img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1285/1299503811_a9d1465d36_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="Tired" style="padding:5px;" align="Right" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/1299503811/)

We made the trek north to my Parent's home the first week of September and had a great time. My Aunt and Uncle, Iris and Gary Baxter had their 40th Wedding Anniversary party so we went and helped them celebrate.

It was a great weekend to go up as the weather was perfect. Jayden and Josie got to go outside and checkout the farm. Jayden helped Grandpa feed the calves and Josie got to play on the trampoline and other toys.

We also got to play with Great Grandpa's four wheeler. [<img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1364/1394999644_c64e533ae0_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="Riding the 4 wheeler at Great Grandpa's farm" style="padding:5px;" align="Left" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/1394999644/)

And Jayden got to ride on Uncle Kelly's forklift with Brianna and Madison.

More recently, Jayden has started riding his bike. It's getting different going on walks now as he'd rather ride his bike over riding in the wagon with Josie. The next thing we need to work on with him is using his brakes. Instead of pushing back on the peddles, he puts his feet down only and his toes touch the ground. He's also trying to use the potty more. We're gaining ground which is good. Josie has been trying to say more words, "Belbo" for Elmo, baby, and "Daday" for Jayden, "Belba" for belly button and bubbles. She's cruising like none other and would climb up on anything if she were allowed. She got another tooth on her left side so she now has 6. We're hoping she'll get some more on her right side. :) We've also concluded that she's a Daddy's Girl. The minute I get home from work she's at my feet if she isn't eating.
