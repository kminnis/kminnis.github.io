Merry Christmas to all! It's been rather fun watching the kids getting ready for Santa to come and their excitement opening their gifts. Last night Jayden and Josie put out Oreo (Jayden calls them Arrow) cookies for Santa. Jayden was concerned that Santa might get hyper after eating them like he does.
