As we were eating tonight we were talking about the future of our TV from the bedroom after we get a new one for the living room. Josie was almost in tears when we said, "No Josie, you can't have a TV in your room. I didn't have one in my room until I was out of high school," I said. Her response, "Yeah, but that was like in the olden days."
