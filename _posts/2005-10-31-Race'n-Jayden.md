Jayden got to wear his racing costume and rode his "bike" around to get his treats. His favorite part was getting back home and eating his [cheetos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/tags/cheetos/) (Thanks Nehru and Karisa). He also is a big fan of [twizzlers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/58019968/). Another food item that he all of a sudden started eating is [bananas](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/58019373/). The last time we shopping for food we decided to pick him up some bananas, but we should have picked them up at the end, because he thought he wanted to eat one in the store. It took a while to get him to forget they were in the shopping cart. :)
