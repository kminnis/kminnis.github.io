Well, we're back from our trek up north. We took off Wednesday night for up north to visit my Parents. They took care of Jayden for us while we went up for a little vacation time in Minneapolis, MN. On our way we stopped at [Cabela's](http://www.cabelas.com/) to see what they had for camping supplies...needless-to-say they were out of what we were looking for. :( Then we stopped at the [Medford Outlet Center](http://www.horizongroup.com/centers/medford.htm). 

While in Minneapolis we stayed at the [Marriott's Fairfield Inn](http://marriott.com/fairfieldinn/default.mi?bc=FN&WT_Ref=MI_Home) which was directly across from the [Mall of America (MOA)](http://www.mallofamerica.com/). We did our power shopping on Friday. I wish I wore a pedometer as I'm sure we probably walked about 20 miles, or at least it seemed like it. We covered all floors about 2-3 times. After the power-shopping we went back to [Ikea](http://www.ikea.com/) (which is conveniently across from the MOA) to pick up some more items that we didn't pick up on our trip there on Thursday night.

As for shopping goes, I found quite a few things to wear from various stores in the MOA, but Kim wasn't as fortunate. So on our way back we stopped at Kohls in Burnsville and finally at the Burnsville Mall. Kim found a ton of clothes she liked at Kohls and a few more in the Mall. The best thing about the whole trip was that clothes are tax free in Minnesota.

We had a wonderful time up north even though it was the coldest time of the spring season to visit. It was in the 30s the mornings we were up there. We hope Jayden didn't wear out Grandpa and Grandma too much. :) (He's working on his 4th tooth so he was a little cranky for them on Friday.)
