Well, seems like another work week is wrapping up. My Dad went through a successful back surgery this morning so that made the day go smoothly. Now for his speedy recovery. He should be out of the hospital tomorrow. Well, Kim and I had her monthly Dr.'s appointment this past Wednesday and we get to go in and have an ultrasound in two weeks. The mid-wife who checked Kim over wasn't concerned about Kim only gaining 1 lb., but would still like to make sure everything's ok with the baby. Well, we're about to head up to Rockwell City to visit Kim's Brother and family then it's off to Humboldt to visit her grandparents. Should be a fun weekend. I'm outta here.
