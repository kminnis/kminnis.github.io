"Man, it's been busy both at work and at home. Last weekend [Jayden was baptized]("http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fjayden%2F011-week9and10). We had  Kim and my parents over along with my Grandparents and Kim's sister and brother's family. It was fun having everyone together. Saturday night we met them all in Ames for some Hickory Park. Yum. Can't seem to ever get enough of good old Hickory Park.

Jayden's growing all the time. One of these days I'll get some video of him on the site so you can watch him cooing and laughing. It's fun to see him finally interacting with us more. He's even started to go to bed on his own...yes, we still have to put him in the crib...he's not walking just yet. "
