So, today is Chad Kraus's last day at [Pioneer](http://www.pioneer.com). He's going to join up with his Dad's family business ([Dairy Queen](http://www.dairyqueen.com)). We decided yesterday to give him one last hurrah before today so we filled his cube with some moving stuff to help him out. Here're some [pictures](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fpioneer%2Fcoworkers) of the results. His desk is usually the most organized of those I work with. We'll miss ya, Chad. Good luck and stop in and see us sometime when you're in town.
