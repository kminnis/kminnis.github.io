So, a lot has happened since my last writing. The group I work with at Pioneer was re-orged, I've been through a bunch of tests for health because of stress from work (reorg, job interviews, etc.), diagnosed to have IBS and have since been de-stressing by running. Oh and today is my 12 year anniversary at Pioneer.

Today I took my first run in them. It will be interesting to see how my body feels tomorrow. I already feel it in my feet. But, wow! I love the feeling of wearing them. I've found so far that I love walking/running in grass and dirt. It gives a whole new dimension to running. I love "feeling mother nature"; the cool feeling from the dirt over the hard blacktop surface. So, we'll see how it goes, but I do want the FiveFingers to "work".

 

Till next time, keep'n it real.
