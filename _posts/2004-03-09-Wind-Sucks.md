Well, it's been a while since I last wrote so I thought I'd do a little blogging. I'm glad today isn't windy as yesterday was just too much. Sunday wasn't much better for wind either. Went to Office Max and got me another compact flash card reader for at work yesterday. When I send in the $10 mail in rebate it'll be free. w00t! Now I'm all set to better document my day with photos. heh

Had a good weekend. Went up north to visit my family and celebrate Kim's b-day. Saturday was kind of weird as my Dad and Grandfather sold 15 heifers to a farmer in Sheffield. They sold a few cattle off as my Dad's going in for surgery on his back this Friday and won't be able to do as much till he heals up. So, hopefully everything goes well in the surgery and he'll have a fast recovery. Hopefully they won't have to sell anything else off till they really want to. It's hard to see them having to sell some off as farming is what they love to do and they've been working at it for their entire life.
