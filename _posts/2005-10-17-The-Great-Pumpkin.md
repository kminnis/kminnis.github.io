This weekend was a fun time of playing out on the farm in search of the great pumpkin. We managed to find the pumkin patch we were looking for near Cumming, IA at the [Howell's Farm](http://www.howellfloral.com/natural_dried_flowers.html). Jayden found the [perfect pumpkin](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/53507290/) for himself and [picked one out for us](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/53507289/) too. I think it will become a tradition to go and visit Howell's each year. They offer a lot of cool things for kids to do. 

Our garbage disposal took a dump on us, no pun intended, this weekend. So, Jayden [helped me out](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/53507326/) in getting the new one ready to go.

You may also have noticed that the above picture links are all pointing to flickr.com. I decided to go the faster route in getting a better gallery going by utilizing flickr. They really do have a cool thing going and it's easy to manage all our photos. So, check out all of our [pictures at flickr.com](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis).
