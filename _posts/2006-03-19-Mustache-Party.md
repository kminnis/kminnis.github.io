This weekend has been pretty quiet. It's been a while since we've just stayed around Ankeny and did very little. Friday I had off from work. It appears that Pioneer is becoming more of government than a business as we get the third Friday off in March now instead of Good Friday. Not sure what that's all about. Oh well, at least they still give us time off.</p>

Anyway, on to the fun stuff. I think it was the week of February 6th, 2006 that I started to grow a goatee to get ready for [Broox's](http://derek.broox.com) mustache party that he had on March 17th. Lucky for me that my hair is leaving the top of my head so I could win the entry for longest/most hair for a mustache. Here's a picture of me [starting out](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/99266055/in/set-72057594084917255/). I think it's with maybe a week's worth of growing. Here's a picture with my [full goatee](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/114240623/in/set-72057594084917255/) and finally, a picture with the [mustache and "handle bars"](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/114241042/in/set-72057594084917255/). haha. The party was a blast and I'm glad that I got to go. Saturday I had to shave it off. Not because Kim wanted me (she hated the facial hair), but because it was annoying to have. The initial itching was done, but I just hated it being around my mouth. It was weird shaving it off as I felt like I was [naked](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/114254317/in/set-72057594084917255/). Even just shaving off the middle of the goatee made my chin feel cold, but now that it's all gone, I really feel the difference. I can actually feel the wind hitting my chin. haha. Oh yeah. And the [Gillette Fusion](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/114253750/in/set-72057594084917255/) that I [won](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/114247757/in/set-72057594084917255/) at the party works awesome!</p>

Here's the full set of pictures for [the mustache party](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/sets/72057594084917255/). Thanks for the good time Broox!
