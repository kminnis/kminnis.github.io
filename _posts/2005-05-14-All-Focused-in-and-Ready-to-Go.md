Well, we decided to trade the truck in. We ended up going to [Willey's of Nevada](http://www.willeyofnevada.com/index.php?PAGE=HOME) to get it traded. They offered a pretty fair price. I got the Ford Focus ZX5. Kim calls it a "cracker box" but I think it get's the job done. It's a lot easier to park than the truck and gets a lot better gas milage. Check out the pictures of me and Jayden in our [new cars in the gallery](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/53496984).
