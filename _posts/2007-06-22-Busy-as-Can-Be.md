Man, talk about a busy time. Where to start. I've been busy [painting the house](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/sets/72157594270061303/) the past three weeks or so. Kim and I are both glad that it's almost done. It's been a challenge for Kim to take care of the kids while I'm out trying to get the painting done. We're almost done as we only have the back deck area to paint.</p> 


A lot has been going on with Josie too. Josie got baptized on May 27th with her Grandpa and Grandma's and Aunt Chris and Kacie watching along. She had surgery on a blocked tear duct on June 6th. It went very well and by the next day we could tell a difference already. It was nerve racking none-the-less, but everything turned out okay. Josie now has 3 teeth and is working on her fourth. They haven't been too difficult which is nice. </p>


Yesterday [Josie turned one](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/sets/72157600424505033/). I took the day off of work so that I could be with her and Jayden and Kim. We went to the Jordan Creek area to get Josie's 1 year photos and then went and hung out at the Jordan Creek Mall for a bit. The kids [played](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/584913907/in/set-72157600424505033/) in the [play area](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/584906053/in/set-72157600424505033/) and Josie got to make a [teddy bear](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/585376546/in/set-72157600424505033/). After coming home we went to Big Creek State Park to play in the water and beach.</p> 
We've had fun [building a sandbox](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/sets/72157600269704580/) for the kids. I think Josie was more interested in it at first, but now, they both seem to like it. It helps when Jayden's friends come over and play in it too.</p> 


 Oh, and we reverted back to a minivan. We were so cramped in our [Pontiac Vibe](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/53448421/) so we traded for a [Chrysler Town &amp; Country](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/543497443/in/photostream/).</p> 
So, all in all we've had a very busy month. Hopefully the summer will get a little quieter, which I'm sure it will once the house is done being painted.</p>
