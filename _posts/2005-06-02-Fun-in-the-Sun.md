Well, Jayden and Kim are camping for the next two weeks. It's kind of nice for Kim to be able to get out of the house, although, she said it can be rather hard getting everything done with Jayden at her hip. ;) Today my coworkers and I got to go to the Iowa Cubs game with the rest of the Pioneer IM group. It was a pretty good time and am glad that we get the opportunity.

Jayden now has 4 teeth and seems to be giving us a little break before getting more. He had his 9 month visit to the Doc today and everything's right on course. Jayden also had his 9 months pictures last week. You can find those along with some more recent pics in [Jayden's 9 month gallery](gallery/thumbnails.php?album=48).
