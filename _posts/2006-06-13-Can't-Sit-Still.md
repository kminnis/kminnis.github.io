Let's see. Where to begin? Life has been busy. Kim's Mom, Pat, had [surgery on her shoulder](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/157385714/) as a result of someone not cleaning up spilled water in the hall at the hospital she works at. We went down over the weekend (May 25-27th) to visit Kim's Mom and Dad and make sure that Pat wasn't doing anything she shouldn't. :) Then we headed back home to have some fun for the rest of Memorial weekend. We took Jayden out to [Big Creek State Park](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/156163923/) so he could play in the sand and water. We took Jayden to the [splash park](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/164174512/in/set-72057594125884367/) when it was in the upper 80s a week ago or so and he [didn't seem to like the water](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/164175733/in/set-72057594125884367/) much. Instead, he liked to play in the grass and follow the fence around. Not sure what that's all about.

In spite of Jayden graduating to his ["big boy chair"](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/164174289/in/set-72057594125884367/) and gaining another 2 pounds (not much, but at least he's holding steady), he's managed to gain his terrible twos attitude a bit early. This past weekend we went up to Hope and Mike's wedding in Emmetsburg, IA. The wedding was short and sweet, but Jayden thought he should make a big deal out of it and wasn't the quiet little boy he usually is. So, I spent half of the wedding in the atrium of the church with Jayden. Next we went to the reception for about a half an hour. Jayden proceeded to want to run around. Kim and I decided we'd just leave early and head back to Rockwell City to visit with her brothers. I guess the lesson in all this is that I don't think we will be able to take Jayden to another wedding anytime soon. I don't blame him any, he's almost 2 and he had been riding in the car for about 2.5 hours.

Kim did okay on the long trip, but I think she's paying for it now. She (and I) can't wait to have the baby! We're not all that excited about the birthing process or the sleepless nights, but more for the comfort of Kim and getting back to normal.

So, yeah, that's almost all that's happened within the last month.
