What a nice long weekend. Kim and I went on a vacation together to [Kansas City](http://www.visitkc.com/) this past weekend, starting on Friday. The last time that I'd driven in Missouri I remember the roads being more to be desired of. And the same held true for this trip. They suck. Pot holes on most of the interstate. We got to [Kansas City](http://www.visitkc.com/) Friday afternoon and decided to walk around [The Country Club Plaza](http://www.countryclubplaza.com) to see what all the shops had. Then went and had supper at [The Melting Pot](http://www.meltingpot.com). Man is that place ever good. I'd highly recommend going there. It's a fondue restaurant. We had the [fondue for two](http://www.meltingpot.com/Files/Menus/menuKansasCity.pdf). We were stuffed after our meal so we decided to walk around some more then headed back to the hotel.

We woke up Saturday morning to find our day was forecasted to be cloudiness and rain. So, instead of going to the zoo we opted to see what else [Kansas City](http://www.visitkc.com/) had to offer. We ventured upon the Union Station, but hadn't had anything for breakfast so we went back up the road to a McDonalds (I think it's the first time eating at a McDonalds for about 2 years). Well, we survived our breakfast without getting shot...Kim pointed out a sign on the wall that said, "Kansas City Police Work Station". On our way back to the [Union Station](http://www.unionstation.org) we saw a huge tower and decided to figure out what it was. It was the [Liberty Memorial Tower](http://www.libertymemorialmuseum.org). So, we took a ride up to the top of it. Pretty neat place to visit. We next made our way to the [Union Station](http://www.unionstation.org). We looked around a bit there and went to the [Science City](http://www.sciencecity.com/) which is part of the [Union Station](http://www.unionstation.org). Next we went to Oak Park Mall near [Kansas City](http://www.visitkc.com/) and then ate at the [Rain Forest Cafe](http://www.rainforestcafe.com). And finally retreated back to our hotel to relax and soak in the hot tub.

Sunday the weather was much improved and we were able to enjoy the [Kansas City Zoo](http://www.kansascityzoo.org/). We saw a lot of cool animals and got to watch the [Coral Reef Adventure](http://www.kansascityzoo.org/Visit/Index.asp?IdS=0049BC-46895C0&Reference=Films&~=) in the [Sprint Imax Theatre](http://www.kansascityzoo.org/Visit/Index.asp?IdS=0049BC-46895C0&x=100|015&~=) The zoo concluded our stay in [Kansas City](http://www.visitkc.com/) and we launched for the home front. 

The end.
