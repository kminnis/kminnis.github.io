As you can tell from my not entering much in my blog that I've been pretty busy. Jayden's growing like a weed and manages to come up with new stuff every day to entertain his parents. For instance, on our way back from a baby shower yesterday he was doing his normal ssssssssccccccreeeeeeeeeeacccccchhhh and making all sorts of noise. All of a sudden it was quiet and we thought what's going on...we looked back and he was sound a sleep. Jayden had his 6 month checkup today and passed with flying colors. He grew another inch and a quarter and weighs about a pound and a half more. He got two shots today :( but managed to not be affected by them too much. He now sits up on his own, but refuses to stand when you hold him up. He's getting better at it, but it isn't something he likes to do.

I've added some more pictures to his [6 month album](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=43) along with some pictures of our [nephews' wrestling](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=42). We went up to watch them wrestle for District a couple of weekends ago.
