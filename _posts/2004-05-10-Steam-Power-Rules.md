So, Kim's Dad, Dale, has a steam powered toy tractor that's been passed down through the family. We got to watch it running yesterday while at her parents place. It runs on solid fuel that looks like paraffin wax. He's running out of the "true" fuel so Kim's brothers put some sterno in it to see if that would work. It worked and was hotter as the steam engine ran faster. The name of the tractor is the [1313 Mamod Steam Tractor](http://www.mamod.co.uk/mobiles.htm) and here's a [buy](http://www.dutchguard.com/page/DG/PROD/TOY/tctr) these things yet. They're made in England and it lists for around $150.
