I usually find watching the weather fun. There's a certain rush to it, but I'm not in favor of bad storms doing damage. Last night at around 11:30 Kim and I woke up to huge wind/rain sounds. After surveying the situation we found it was actually hail hitting the side of the house with a bunch of wind. Here's a picture of the [hail on the deck](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fhouse%2Fpictures&img=res57902.jpg). We also found a small spot that was leaking on the ceiling where the kitchen/great room roof meets the rest of the house. Any normal rain it doesn't leak but with winds at around 50-60 mph the water made its way through. At least we didn't have as bad of storms as people in [other states](http://www.theiowachannel.com/weather/3025972/detail.html).
