Man, time has been flying by. Monday (June 1) was my 5th year of service at Pioneer. It really doesn't seem like it's been that long. Here's a list of some things that have happened since I graduated and started working for Pioneer. 

1. Pioneer was purchased by DuPont.

1. I survived an apartment fire in the building I was living in.

1. I have purchased two different houses (a townhouse and then a regular house).

1. I got married a year and about 2 months ago.

1. Kim and I are expecting a baby in August.

1. I've gained about 5 lbs since graduating.

1. I don't have as much hair on the top of my head.


Yesterday I went and picked up my birthday present from Kim. It's early, but I couldn't wait any longer. For her birthday I got her ISU license plates (KM4ISU). So she got me some for my b-day.
