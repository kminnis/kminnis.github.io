Well, it finally happened. Jayden turned 2 on Tuesday.  Boy how time has flown.  He thinks he's such a [big boy now](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/229804216/in/set-72157594261191875/)! Over the weekend we had [Jayden's birthday party](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/sets/72157594261191875/).  He had a good time and was wore out by the days end. He was spoiled rotten with toys, toys and more toys. Because Jayden is always so excited about [play kitchens](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/224923368/in/set-72157594211016050/), we decided to get him one of his own.  Along with it, he received a lot of [play food](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/224921609/in/set-72157594211016050/) and [accessories](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/224922296/in/set-72157594211016050/). He loves it to pieces and is ready to cook you up a meal when you come over. He doesn't know yet that metal can't go in the microwave! I think he takes after his dad because his mom is no Betty Crocker.

We decided to have something different for his birthday party this weekend. Most parents would probably get a clown or go some place cool, but we decided to have some fun with Pop and candy. You can watch the [Mentos and Diet Coke video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTF9zXhfdLY) on YouTube. I think Jayden had more fun with that than he would have with a clown. haha (Or maybe it's his parents and family that had more fun). Here are some pictures as well of the [Mentos &amp; Diet Coke fun](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/sets/72157594261662957/).

On Jayden's B-day, we took him to the [Blank Park Zoo](http://www.blankparkzoo.com/) ([Pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/sets/72157594261191866/)).  Although, it's not quite like the Omaha Zoo, we still had a good time.  He got to feed the goats and watch his dad get [attacked by them](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/229818800/in/set-72157594261191866/). Probably his favorite thing was [riding the train](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/229834069/in/set-72157594261191866/).  He LOVES trains right now. Especially Thomas the Tank Engine.

We took the plunge and got Jayden and Josie's pictures taken last Friday.  It was a challenge but we managed to get a few cute poses.  Some of you will be receiving copies in the mail, but you can look at them on line soon. We've started the fun process of painting the outside of the house.  We are leaving it white but changing the trim to a reddish/burgundy/cranberry color.  Right now it's a little bright.  We hope it darkens a bit when we put another coat on.  We are at least getting the front done, and then we'll worry about the rest next spring/summer.

Josie is growing like a weed and changes everyday I swear.  Jayden has started to pester her a bit more, but really could care less about her.  Hopefully someday he'll stick up for her!
