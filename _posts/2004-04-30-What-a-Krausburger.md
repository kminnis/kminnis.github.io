Well, the guys at work and I were talking about [Google's](http://www.google.com) page ranking and how to get it higher. We also were talking about how some pages don't seem to be showing up in the [Google](http://www.google.com) search results. So, we're all going to try this on our sites ([Derek Brooks](http://derek.broox.com) and [Nick Leeper](http://www.lucky-33.com)) and see what happens. Here's a link to a [Krausburger](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/53444086/). It's really just a fictitious name of a burger named after one of our co-workers Kraus (who we're sad to see leaving Pioneer). Now all that's left is for [Google](http://www.google.com) to index our sites.
