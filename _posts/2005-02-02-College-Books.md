So it's been at least 6 years since I've opened a lot of my college books relating to database management and design. Well, today I pulled out a couple of them to reference some information on database design. It's kind of cool how everyday brings something new/different to the plate at work. That's why I like working in the field I'm in so much, never a dull moment and always a day of learning ahead.
