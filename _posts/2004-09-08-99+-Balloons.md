"Yesterday I went back to work after taking the week off to bond with Jayden and help Kim out. My co-workers decided to have some fun with my office cube so they decorated it with a [ton of balloons]("http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fpioneer%2Fballoons). It was fun reading the balloons as some had [stuff written on them]("http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fpioneer%2Fballoons&img=res201660187.jpg).

Last night Jayden slept like a charm. Monday night he was ""master of the house"" and cried until 12:30 AM, Tuesday morning. He wasn't eating very well and we had no clue what was going on in his world. We made it through it though. I am definitely glad when he does decide to sleep when it's the right time to sleep (actually, he sleeps a lot as it is...what the life! :) )."
