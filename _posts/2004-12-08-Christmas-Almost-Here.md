Where to begin...I haven't written for so long I don't know where to start. Jayden's growing like you wouldn't believe. He now is holding his toys and of course drops them so you have to pick them up. Fortunately, he doesn't realize he's dropping them yet. He's up to 7 oz of milk and gets pissed if you don't give him his milk right away when he's hungry. Last weekend he stayed with Grandpa and Grandma Wagner so Kim and I could go on a retreat with our small group from Church. He was a good boy and only puked up once on his clothes for Aunt Chris. Jayden's doing more than cooing now as he tends to screech when he tries to talk. He's also sleeping through the night and almost falls asleep on his own. Some nights he falls asleep with out crying, but other nights he cries for 15 minutes or so. Oh, and our little man also sits up pretty well with our help and likes to look around quite a bit. But, he rejects the notion of tummy time as he hates to lay on his stomach.
