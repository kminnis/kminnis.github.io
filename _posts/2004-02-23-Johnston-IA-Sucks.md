Okay, I've decided that I should mention that Johnston, IA isn't the place for me to live. 

Here is a list of why it's not the place for me:

1. There is a stop light on every block and the light never changes when you're the only one there.

1. The roads suck in winter. Johnston City crews come out when it's too late and the roads are already packed with snow/ice.

1. There is a cop on every corner sitting where everyone can see them with a radar gun clocking every car, bicycle and pedestrian going by.

1. The speed limit is incredibly slow. You can have a corn field on both sides of you and it will still be 25 mph.

1. From Kim's experience with the schools, parents are rich snobs who could care less about anyone else except themselves. Oh and their kids are perfect too.
