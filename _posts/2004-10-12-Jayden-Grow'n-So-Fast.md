I realize it's been a while since I last wrote, but time kind of gets away when you have a little one. I can only wait to see how time flies when we have another one. :) Jayden's been growing like a weed. He's starting to coo a lot more and smiles when he sees Kim or me. He makes such good [facial expressions too](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fjayden%2F008-week6&img=res939537948.jpg). Kim's also been getting Jayden in to [many](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fjayden%2F008-week6&img=res706757178.jpg) [different](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fjayden%2F008-week6&img=res1156800000.jpg) [outfits](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fjayden%2F007-week5&img=res2096095278.jpg). I may be partial because I'm Jayden's Dad, but doesn't he look cute? :) We've found that he likes to fall asleep when riding around in the car so we will always have that to fall back on if he starts to be fussy at night. He's been doing really well when it comes to being a good little boy. He fusses at night some, but that's to be expected. He is up to 5 oz of formula and probably weighs between 9 and 10 pounds by now. He has also grown out of some of his clothes already. :( And to top it all off, he's starting to find his hands.
