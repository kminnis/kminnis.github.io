So, at work we've been playing a little game on one of our co-workers (Chad Kraus). It all started when we put a donut on a note on his desk while he was vacationing at the end of last year. Well, we decided to put the donut and note in his desk. That wasn't all bad in itself, but then we decided to take it to the next level. We started collecting various foods and put them in his desk drawer. Then one day he started to smell "pickles" in his pen drawer (little did he know that one drawer down he had a Quizno's Pepper bar). We thought, "Oh, wait, we can't have him find the drawer so we switched drawers with Cedric. We then moved the food drawer back yesterday. Well, today we got girl scout cookies delivered by Bob's daughter and he decided to put them in the food drawer. Well, he opened the drawer far enough to find the hidden treasures. LOL. Go here to find the [photo gallery](/donut).
