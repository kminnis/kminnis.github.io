Ah, it's so good to have Kim back from her trip to Florida. Friday afternoon and Saturday were fun days. Went up to Ames to hang out with a college buddy. We snapped some photos of various things at ISU and went to the movie Paycheck. A flick worth seeing.

I think there should be something done about Monday mornings. Have you ever had a morning where you put cereal in your glass instead of the bowl. At least I didn't put the cereal box in the fridge and the milk in the cupboard. haha
