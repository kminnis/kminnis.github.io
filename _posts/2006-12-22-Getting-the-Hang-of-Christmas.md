Sorry to all of my viewers for not updating for more than a month. It's been a busy time of year, between getting Christmas presents purchased and a project at work, I haven't had a lot of time to get this updated.

Last weekend we had Christmas on the Wagner side. We all had a good time and watched the normal movie, ["Christmas Vacation"](http://imdb.com/title/tt0097958/). We all got some good [presents](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/328741498/in/set-72157594398481699/) and more [presents](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/328742709/in/set-72157594398481699/).
Yesterday Kim and the kids hung out with Emily and Mady. The kids exchanged gifts and apparently Jayden wanted to keep opening gifts...even though there weren't anymore. So, I think Jayden is getting the hang of Christmas or at least the gift part. haha.

Josie has been growing a bit...not as fast as Jayden did at her age, but still growing. She had her 6 month checkup yesterday and was a whole 12 pounds. She's starting to sit up on her own now. She'll sit for about a minute then fall over.

Don't forget to good and if you need help tracking Santa be sure to  visit the [Santa Tracking Site](http://www.noradsanta.org/en/default.php).

Merry Christmas!
