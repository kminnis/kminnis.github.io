Wow, almost a month since the last update! Last week I was in Florida for almost a week to attend the Informatica World 2007 conference. I learned a lot and had a good time hanging out with [Broox](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/482220243/in/set-72157600170654806/) and [Kevi](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/482210684/in/set-72157600170654806/). [Broox](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/482218097/in/set-72157600170654806/) was down there for and RFID conference so the timing was perfect. The weather was perfect too. It would have been fun if Kim would have gone with too, but that will have to wait till the next trip.

Back at the home ranch...the kids are doing pretty well. Josie is working on getting some teeth now so Sunday night was a tiring night as she didn't want to sleep much. It amazes me how growing teeth can be so painful. Josie's also crawling all over the place including going up any and all stairs she can find. Of course she can't come back down yet, so we have to run up and get her.

Jayden has been keeping his end of the deal up being an almost 3 year old; the almost daily melt down and his big brother attitude. He is as curious as ever and loves to "do things on his own". In his words, "I will do it!". 

Kim was very busy taking care of the kids last week, as well as, organizing a garage sale ([Jayden's pile](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/483404183/) and [Josie's Pile](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/483403715/in/photostream/)). It went over pretty well and we got rid of quite a bit of stuff. It amazes me how much stuff one accumulates having kids.

It's good to be back in the groove now, but the Florida trip was fun. See more [pictures in the Informatica Set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/sets/72157600170654806/)
