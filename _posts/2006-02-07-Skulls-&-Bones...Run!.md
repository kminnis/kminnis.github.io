Today Kim had an ultrasound for Baby #2. It was just as cool as it was with Jayden to see all the pieces and parts of Baby #2. I'm sure that all babies look the same when they're inside. Take for example, [picture 1 (Baby #2)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/96858785/in/set-72057594060862779/) and [picture 2 (Jayden)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/53457457/in/set-1178282/). They both look like aliens. At any rate, everything's looking normal and we are quite pleased.</p>

Another cool thing happened Sunday. Jayden finally took his own steps to and from Kim and me. We couldn't be any more pleased. :)</p>
