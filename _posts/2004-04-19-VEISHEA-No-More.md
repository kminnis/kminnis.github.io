Friday was a good day to have off. I first cleaned our front deck so that I could seal it on Saturday. Then went up to Ames to ride around on my bike with a good friend, "S" (Scott Heider). We rode around Welch Ave and then hit some trails. Got to see a bunch of college students lining up at the bars at 3:00 PM.

Saturday Kim and I went up to Ames to watch the [VEISHEA](http://www.veishea.org/) parade and then walk around campus to see what's all changed. Toured through the new College of Business building and got some free cotton candy. Yum. Quite a nice building...too bad it wasn't there when I was attending ISU.

So, all in [VEISHEA](http://www.veishea.org/) land was good and then came a long these punks that think they're adults. Well, these punks go and start a riot that created quite a mess and loss for Welch Ave. businesses and the city of Ames. Now comes the question if [VEISHEA](http://www.veishea.org/) will continue. I find it disheartening that these little brats could cause something that's been going on for the past 80 years to not happen again. I look at [VEISHEA](http://www.veishea.org/) as a time to get together with friends, see what's new on campus, ingest a few cherry pies, and in the future take my kids to see the parade and visit the activities setup on central campus. If [VEISHEA](http://www.veishea.org/) ceased to exist you wouldn't get to see and hear the [Groove](http://www.stuorg.iastate.edu/groove/). The list goes on as to what you'd miss. Something needs to be done, but I hope it's not the killing of [VEISHEA](http://www.veishea.org/).
