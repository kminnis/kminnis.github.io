Well, yesterday Kim and I went for our now weekly Doctor's visit. The Doc said everything was A-Okay and Kim could go ahead and have the baby any time as we're at full term. So we sit and wait. The Doc also thought it would be around 6 lbs or so when born. So, for those of you who are wagering on the stats, that little bit of info might increase your odds. Kim's certainly ready to have it and wants to get back to a somewhat normal life. Yeah, we'll have the baby coming up here, but she can't wait to be able to go bike and do stuff that she used to do before being pregnant. :)
