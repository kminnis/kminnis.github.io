Okay, so it's been a while since I last wrote...which seems like the norm so far. Today Kim had her baby checkup and things are looking good. She gained the one pound that she lost two weeks ago so the Doctor was happy and didn't give her a hard time for losing weight. The Doctor was also pleased that all her numbers look good and the baby shows all signs of being healthy and energetic like his/her mom. :)

Sunday, Monday and Tuesday morning my [Sister and her family](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Ffamily%2Fkarrie) were in town to visit since we aren't traveling very far from Ankeny. We all had a great time showing them around the Metro area, as well as, the Iowa State campus. We even managed to get up to [Ledges State Park](http://www.state.ia.us/dnr/organiza/ppd/ledges.htm).

Last Friday we had .8" of rain and then had 1" of rain on Saturday so we had a little bit of urban flooding. The grass is really lush and green so I had to mow yesterday. I'd much rather mow then have it dry and brown.
