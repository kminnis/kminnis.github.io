Well, we've decided to sell the truck. We're trying to only have one car payment or 2 with one of the payments being small. We've been the sole owner of it. It's been well maintained and had all recalls performed by the dealer. More pictures can be seen in the [Truck Album](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=47). So if you're interested in providing our truck with a good home see the details below.
