OK. Finally, I'm updating my blog and the design. I decided to give [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) a try. It's pretty cool so far, but I haven't gotten the gallery to fit into the whole theme just yet. The gallery and web cam are now links under the pages structure. More will come later as I figure more things out. Hopefully the Google robots will find my site friendly and provide some better search results that actually point to links. :)

To give you an update on Jayden. He's now 7+ months old and is getting more "grown" up everyday. He's sitting up in shopping carts by himself and has graduated to a bigger car seat. He likes to play in water and likes to wear his shades outside. [Pictures of Jayen at 7 months.](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=45) He also likes to visit the farm and see the[ baby calves](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/displayimage.php?pos=-1140). While we were up at the farm this last weekend we also celebrated my [Grandfather's 80th birthday](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=44). It was pretty cool. My Grandmother had kept some items that my Great Grandmother had kept for my Grandpa.  One of those items was a speach that he had written for school and then his first baby tooth. :) Kind of neat to be able to hang on to something like that for 80 years. 

Kim's doing great now that she gets to go outside and play with Jayden. She's looking forward to working for Campfire USA for about 2 weeks here in the Spring.
