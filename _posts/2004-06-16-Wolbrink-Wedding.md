Man, what a busy time it has been. Last Friday (6-11-2004) Kim and I started our way towards [Door County, WI](http://snipurl.com/74tr) to attend one of my friend's wedding ([Dan & Rose Wolbrink](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/164159723/in/set-72157594161383062/)). The wedding took place on [Rock Island State Park](http://snipurl.com/74tv) which required about a 45 minute ride on the [Washington Island, Island Clipper](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinminnis/164157242/in/set-72157594161383062/). We all weren't sure if we'd be having the wedding outdoors or if we would be indoors on the island, but the weather cooperated and the wedding was held outside. It was quite the adventure and I'm glad that Kim and I were included. There were quite a few people from the church that I attended while living in Mason City that I got to see while out there which was fun. Some of them I haven't seen for about 8 years.

The weather along the lake was quite different than here in warm muggy Iowa. It was around the 50's and 60's on the way out to the island and got warmer inland, but not like it would have been here. Kim and I stayed at [Bailey's Harbor Yacht Club Resort](http://www.bhyc.com/) which was a very nice place and I would highly recommend staying there if you ever went out that way. The thing that was the hardest on the trip was returning home going across Wisconsin on Highway 21. The roads were OK, but the slowing down for all these little towns left much to be desired. Luckily we didn't find any closed roads going out or returning. While traveling, areas of Wisconsin received heavy amounts of rain and caused a few road closures.
