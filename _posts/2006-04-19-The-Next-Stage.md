Okay, so it's been a month since you've last heard from me. Yeah, it's been pretty busy. A lot of time has been spent chasing after Jayden. I'm not complaining though as it's so nice to have him mobile now. He likes to help out with about anything if you let him. We put together his dresser that we got at IKEA a while back and he was right in there trying to help out. We (thanks Grandma Wagner for your help) repainted the "guest" room, which is now his, and moved his new twin bed into it. He had no problem transitioning into his twin bed and so far (knock on wood) hasn't even fallen out of it. The first week that we moved him in he was busy trying to take all the stuffed animals from his old room to his new one.

Works been going good. I've been good and busy, but it's been hard to concentrate and do the whole "work smarter, not harder" because of some events that might be happening next week. I had a whole bit written about it, but decided to not include it in fear of getting in trouble for it. So, you'll have to wait till after next week to see what might or might not have happened.
