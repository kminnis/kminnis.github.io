Well, I'm finally done finishing the floor. I started out thinking I'd sand the whole floor which included removing all the old finish with a hand held orbital sander last Thursday. It looked as though it would take a week to finish at the rate I was going so I rented a finishing sander from Menards last Friday and had the floor sanded down by Saturday Morning. It's a time consuming process, but well worth it in the end. Here's what the floor looked like be fore [(Old Floor 1)](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fhouse%2Fpictures&img=res44562.jpg) and [(Old Floor 2)](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fhouse%2Fpictures&img=res44568.jpg) and here's what it looks like now [(New Floor 1)](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fhouse%2Fpictures&img=res61756.jpg) and [(New Floor 2)](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fhouse%2Fpictures&img=res61757.jpg). I one coat of finish on Saturday and put two down on Sunday. It's good to be done making a mess.
