Today's turning out to be a wonderful day. It's hard to imagine what $15 can give you these days. Kim went in for her ultrasound today to get a checkup for the baby. Her last visit she hadn't gained the 3-4 lbs. that the Doctors/Nurses said she should so they scheduled her for an ultrasound. Kim was pretty quiet and nervous this morning before we went as she was fearful something would be wrong. Well, everything turned out just fine and the baby has 10 fingers and 10 toes and by the measurements is 2 days ahead of schedule on growth. :) The baby weighed in at 11 oz. 

It's something that can't be put into words the description of watching the baby swimming around in Kim's belly. The baby was moving all around and liked to wave at us while getting the ultrasound. We could easily see the heart and it's valves opening and closing, the brain, eye lenses, kidneys, stomach, ribs, spine, arms, and legs. The only thing we didn't see (or want to find out) was the prominent placement of a special organ that determines the sex. Hehe. So, that'll be a surprise for us yet. You can see the pictures in the gallery under [before birth](gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fjayden%2Fprebirth).
