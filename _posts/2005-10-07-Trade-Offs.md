Well, you saw it here first. Kim decided that she ain't a "Minivan Girl" so we decided to trade off the minivan and got a Pontiac Vibe. It's a pretty fun car to drive and is cheaper to drive than the van ever was (hopefully 35 mpg). We purchased it from [Bob Brown GMC](http://www.bobbrownisuzu.com/) in Ankeny (Jamie Widen was our sales person). We were very happy with the way they treated us. Unlike Ramsey, they actually wanted our business.

Jayden's been learning like mad. He's now [pulling his phone around](https://photos.app.goo.gl/QghJMmY94PXdv7To9) by the cord like it was his once lost puppy. He's pushed through 2 more teeth this last weekend. He's cruising furniture now. He loves popcorn, but won't eat very many food groups. He can clap, do the "so big" move, dance a little (sitting of course) and has just started noticing his hair. We went for his physical therapy session yesterday, but the therapist called in sick and they forgot to call us. :( So, we'll continue to have Jayden kneel on and push his [little cart](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/image/jayden/year1_1/IMG_1630.jpg). He also enjoys bouncing on the yoga ball we got to help him do his exercises.
