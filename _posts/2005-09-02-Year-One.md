Man, where has the time gone. Jayden celebrated his [1 year birthday](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/image/jayden/year1/IMG_1465.jpg) last Monday. He did OK until [everyone sang](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/image/jayden/year1/IMG_1506.jpg) "Happy Birthday" to him. He got lots of gifts and he is really [thankful](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/image/jayden/year1/IMG_1549.jpg) for those of you who gave him something. Ah yes, and he's finally mastered [holding his own sippy cup](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/image/jayden/year1/IMG_1459.jpg). Check out his [Year 1 gallery](http://www.kevinminnis.com/gallery/album/jayden/year1).

Today he went in for his 1 year checkup. They gave him his two shots and stole some blood from him. Needless to say, it pissed him off royally. He's at 19.1 lbs and I think 30 inches. 

As you may have seen I modified the gallery a bit. It's more simple to manage and now has friendly URLs. Hope you like it. Sometime I'll be adding a frame to the front page that shows the newly updated pictures. It'll probably take me a bit to fix previous articles with links to the old gallery so be patient.
