So I'm sitting here copying some floppy disks to a network drive so I can get to them from my computer here at work. In fact, I have my "a" drive disabled on my workstation because I never use it. I can't remember the last time that I've even used one. I usually use my trusty USB drive or ftp to my host computer. I can't believe how incredibly slow the drive is. I'm certainly glad technology has improved over the years.

So, here are some [pictures](gallery/index.php?path=pictures%2Fisu%2F2004-02-28) that I took this last weekend at ISU. Some are funny some are not. It's always fun to document a day with photos.
